# Auto Price Prediction

## Overview
To be able to predict used cars or bikes market value can help both buyers and sellers. 
There are lots of individuals who are interested in the used car market at some points in their life because they wanted to sell their car or buy a used car. In this process, it’s a big corner to pay too much or sell less then it’s market value. Keeping this in mind, this project is built to give better estimated market value at which the buyer or seller can buy or sell them.

CRISP-DM methodology is followed while building this project
